📌 **Welcome to the Predicted Spotify Stream Project!**  
This project leverages **Machine Learning** to predict the number of streams a song might get based on various features like **artist popularity, genre, release year, and more!**  

## 🔍 Project Overview  
🎶 **Goal:** Predict a song’s Spotify stream count using data-driven insights.  
📊 **Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
📂 **Dataset:** Collected from Spotify’s API & other sources  

## 🛠️ Features Implemented  
✅ **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
✅ **Feature Engineering & Selection**  
✅ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
✅ **Machine Learning Model (Regression & Neural Networks)**  
✅ **Hyperparameter Tuning for Best Accuracy**  

## 📈 Models Used  
- 🔹 **Linear Regression**  
- 🔹 **Random Forest Regressor**  
- 🔹 **XGBoost**  
- 🔹 **Neural Networks** (for advanced predictions)  

## 🚀 Future Enhancements  
🔜 **Deploying the model as a web app**  
🔜 **Integrating real-time Spotify API data**  
🔜 **Improving accuracy with deep learning techniques**
